A hippo's enormous size lends itself to creating microhabitats for smaller organisms. They facilitate habitats for fish populations by repeatedly walking on common pathways from water sources to inland areas. They have adapted an ability to produce a red, oily liquid which acts as a natural sunblock.Fascinatingly, hippos can identify a friend from foe by smelling their dung - or poop! Hippos use middens, or outdoor areas where they repeatedly go to the bathroom. Hippos can then sniff the area to find out who has been there, and if they are considered a friend.
